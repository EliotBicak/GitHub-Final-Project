# GitHub-Final-Project
The Final Project of an IBM course demonstrating GitHub/Git CLI skills learned.

My goal for this project is to demonstrate that I know how to create an open-source project in Git, make changes to that project, and make it available to the community. I can fork a GitHub repository, clone it to your local system, make changes to the local repository, commit the changes locally, push it back to your GitHub fork, and create a pull request to add your update to the original repository.



Create a calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
Output
   simple interest = p*t*r
